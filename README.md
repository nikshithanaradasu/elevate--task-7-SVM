# Task 7: Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Objective:
Implement SVM with Linear and RBF kernel for binary classification using the Breast Cancer dataset.

## Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Results:
- Linear SVM Accuracy: ~95.61%
- RBF SVM Accuracy: ~98.25%
- RBF with Tuned Parameters: ~98.25%

## Key Takeaways:
- RBF kernel performed better on non-linear data.
- Hyperparameter tuning improved the accuracy.
- SVMs are powerful even with small datasets.
